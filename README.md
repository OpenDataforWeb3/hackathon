# **Hackathon**

This repository serves as an archive for all ODC hackathon materials, including entries, instructions, and other related materials.

## Resources

There will be a hackathon channel on our discord for each hackathon hosted by or in collaboration with the ODC. The channel will be named after the hackathon (e.g. DataBuilder-Hackathon-2023)

Along with that, we have an archive for each hackathon we have hosted, with folders in this repository containing hackathon material and a structured list of submissions sorted by bounty.
